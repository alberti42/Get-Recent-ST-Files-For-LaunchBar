# Get Recently Opened Files with Sublime Text for LaunchBar

This repository provides an action for [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/actions.html) for accessing recent documents opened with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). The actions are designed to streamline access to recent files for users of Sublime Text who also happen to use LaunchBar.

:information_source: The LaunchBar action is designed to work together with the companion plugin [`Recent Files Tracker`](https://github.com/alberti42/sublime-recent-files-tracker) for Sublime Text editor.
